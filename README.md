## How to Play: S.T.U.D.Y.

**Objective:**  Two players embody the conflict between their  _Past Self_  and  _Future Self_. The goal is to outwit your opponent and achieve your desired outcomeâ€”either succumbing to distractions or enforcing discipline.

**Setup:**

-   **Past Self Player:**  Represents your procrastinating tendencies.
-   **Future Self Player:**  Represents your disciplined aspirations.
-   The game alternates between turns where each player makes strategic choices.

**Gameplay Instructions:**

1.  **Understand the Scenario:**
    -   Each round begins with a scenario (e.g., preparing for an exam or avoiding homework). The situation is displayed at the top of the game screen.
2.  **Choose Wisely:**
    -   **Past Self Turn:**  The Past Self selects a procrastination tactic from the available choices.
    -   **Future Self Turn:**  The Future Self picks a counteraction to disrupt the Past Self's plan.
3.  **Score Points:**
    -   After both players have chosen, the game determines the winner of the round based on strategy and randomness:
        -   If  **Past Self Wins**, procrastination prevails, and the Past Self gains a point.
        -   If  **Future Self Wins**, discipline triumphs, and the Future Self scores a point.
4.  **First to 5 Wins:**
    -   The game continues with different scenarios until either the Past Self or the Future Self scores 5 points, declaring them the winner.
